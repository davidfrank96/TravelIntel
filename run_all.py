"""
Convenience entry point that exercises the full application pipeline and
its accompanying tests in a single run.  Useful for local deployments or CI
checks where you want to ensure every component works end-to-end.

Usage:
    python run_all.py

The following steps are executed sequentially:

  1. Scraper sanity tests (`test_scrapers.py`)
  2. NLP enhancement tests (`test_nlp_enhancements.py`)
  3. Insight analyzer grading tests (`test_insight_analyzer.py`)
  4. NLP validation (`validate_nlp.py`)
  5. Full data pipeline run (`main.py`)
  6. Streamlit dashboard launch (runs in background)

If any step fails, the script will abort and report the failure.  Once all
steps complete successfully, the Streamlit dashboard is automatically launched
at http://localhost:8501.
